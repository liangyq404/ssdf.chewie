        <h2>What exactly is Chewie?</h2>
        <p>
            Chewie is like upgraded bubble-gum, <strong>but more than that</strong>. It comes with more choice not only for the flavor but also the physical texture. The chewing experience that Chewie provides is based on a simulation of chewing real
            food, which is an old habit decaded in the past decades.

        <h2>What is Chewie made of?</h2>
        <p>
            The ingredients of Chewie are mainly from natural extracts, with different formula for different tastes and textures. The base of the chewable piece is food grade silicone, which made Chewie 100% safe to chew. It also uses the similar formula for bubble-gum,
            so don't worry about swallowing it - you body is able to excrete it.

        <h2>How old do I have to be to get my Chewie? </h2>
        <p>
            Chewie has different plans for different age groups, but we only recommend kids older than 6 to use Chewie. From the age of six, children will go through the tooth replacement stage, when they git rid of the baby teeth and the grinding teeth grow out.
            That's when we expect Chewie to make the most of it.
